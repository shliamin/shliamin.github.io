                <h2>Developer in heart, learning about UI/UX design and interaction design</h2>
                <p>I am Justian Spijkerbosch. A full stack developer from Apeldoorn, Netherlands. I have been a hobby programmer for a number of years and since mid 2021 I have been studying computer science in Utrecht, the Netherlands. At this moment I am doing an internship at MrBoost –∏ running my own freelancing company called justian.dev.</p>
                <p>My daily life</p>
                <p>I am currently doing an internship at MrBoost, completing year 2 of my degree. At MrBoost I am trying to fully focus on becoming a better UI/UX designer and interaction developer, I am doing this through learning about techniques such as GSAP and ThreeJS.</p>
                <p>Besides wanting to become a better UI/UX designer and interaction developer, I am also always trying out (new) techniques and building cool projects with them, either for myself, or for others. For which you can also <a href="#">hire me</a>.</p>

                <h3>Education and work experiences</h3>
                <p>A few things that I've done to gain experiences in my field.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MrBoost - Internship</strong> (2023 - Current) <br> At MrBoost I am currently following an internship focused on becoming a better UI/UX designer and interaction designer. I am trying to learn ThreeJS and GSAP here by just practical experiments.</li>
                    <li><strong>University of Applied Sciences - Computer Science</strong> (2021 - Current) <br> At the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht, I am doing a study called OPEN-ICT. What this basically means is that I have 4 different periods per year where I work with a fixed group on a project per period. For the rest everything is relatively free: for example, I can choose what programming language I want to use and what user stories I want to tackle.</li>
